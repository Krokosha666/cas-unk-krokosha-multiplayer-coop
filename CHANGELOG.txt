(my abandoned YT channel): https://www.youtube.com/@Krokosha666


KNOWN ISSUES:
Save system does not work.
Extreme lag for clients.
Extreme lag with larger time scale.
Optimization doesn't really exist rn, actually.
Gun jamming might desync
Worldgen is not synced at all. But my object sync streams the world to the clients pretty accurately.
Physics sync is wrong outside of hosts view.
Ragdoll just teleports around i know.
Sometimes world generation screen on host might freeze for like a minute and idk whyy
This mod entirely consists of zero-effort schizo code written on a phone, it's a miracle that it works.
