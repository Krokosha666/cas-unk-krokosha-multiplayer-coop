KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Save system does not work.
 - Extreme lag for clients.
 - Extreme lag with larger time scale.
 - Optimization doesn't really exist rn, actually.
 - Gun jamming might desync
 - Worldgen is not synced at all. But my object sync streams the world to the clients pretty accurately.
 - Ragdoll just teleports around i know.
 - Sometimes world generation screen on host might freeze for like a minute and idk whyy
 - This mod entirely consists of zero-effort schizo-code written on a phone, it's a miracle that it works.
