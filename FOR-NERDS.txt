"Casualties: Unknown" Co-op mod by Krokosha666
(my abandoned YT channel): https://www.youtube.com/@Krokosha666

# Port Forwarding:
This mod uses UDP protocol.
Default port: 7790 

# Console commands:
This mod adds mutliplayer-exclusive console commands.

Write "krok help" into the console to see them all.

"krok rule sv_cheats 1" to enable all commands (server-only)
"krok rule AllowClientCheatCommands 1" to enable all commands for clients (none of them are synced, only tp works)
"krok maxplayers [number]" (default is 8)

"krok rules" to see game rules
"krok rule [rule name] [value]" is for:
	- enable permadeath
	- re-enable changing time speed 
	- re-enable sleeping 
	- and much more things for people to tweak the game into a better experience 
"krok kick [name]" to forcibly disconnect a player
also some commands that require player name as input can accept macros: 
 - "@m" (local player)  
 - "@a" (everyone)
 - "@r" (random)
 - "@c" (anyone at your cursor location (if theres no one it will fail) )
 - so you can do "krok heal @a" - which heals everyone
 - or you can do "krok heal @c" - which heals someone at your cursor 


# Keybinds:
"krokosha_coop_pointfingerat" default: Mouse2
"krokosha_coop_voice_chat" default: V
"krokosha_coop_chat" default: Slash

Are added to the "keybinds.json" automatically.


# Available startup os command arguments:  
--ksmulti-immidiate-start	// start the world as soon as the game initializes 
--ksmulti-setstarttutorial  // requires immidiate start, makes the world start in tutorial
--ksmulti-verbose			// logs more info about synchronization (useful for reporing bugs)
--ksmulti-ip-port 127.0.0.1:7790   // override ip and port
--ksmulti-setname My_Custom_User_Name  // override username
--ksmulti-sethost			// set network system into host mode
--ksmulti-setclient			// DEFAULT, set network system into client mode
--ksmulti-startnetwork		// start the network system as soon as the game initializes (if host, it starts the server with specified port, if client, it tries to connect to the ip)
--ksmulti-setrule [rule] [value] // set a game rule before start, in in-game console enter "krok rules" to see them all

EXAMPLE: "CasualtiesUnknown.exe --ksmulti-ip-port 127.0.0.1:25565 --ksmulti-setrule sv_cheats 1 --ksmulti-setrule PLAYER_COUNT_LIMIT 20 --ksmulti-setname MyNameJeff --ksmulti-sethost --ksmulti-startnetwork --ksmulti-immidiate-start"

btw, this mod does not support running as headless/dedicated servers because of how the game is built, and the mod (simply not possible)

# This mod uses "Unity Netcode for GameObjects" library version 1.7.1
